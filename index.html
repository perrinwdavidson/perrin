    <h1>Hey, I'm Perrin.</h1>

    <p>
      I'm an undergraduate at the University of Chicago where I am working toward a B.A. in Physics with Honors and a B.S. in Computational and Applied Mathematics with Honors.

    <h2>Research Interests</h2>

    <p>
      Currently, I work under Professor David Archer in the Department of Geophysical Sciences at UChicago and under Dr. Ken O. Buesseler at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. 
      In both labs, I work to develop data-constrained oceanographic models using statistical and physical techniques. 
      Specifically, I am interested in applying machine learning to inverse modeling and regression problems to further reduce error in theoretical carbon model output.

    <p> 
      In my work, I commonly come back to the statistics aphorism attributed to George E. P. Box
      <blockquote cite="https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2010.00442.x">
        <i>"All models are wrong, but some are useful."</i>
      </blockquote>
      It is therefore my job as an aspiring modeler to make all my models useful. I mean, who wants a worthless model? I certainly don't...
