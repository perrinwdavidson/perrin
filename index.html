    <h1>Hey, I'm Perrin.</h1>

    <p>
      I'm an undergraduate at the University of Chicago where I am working toward a B.A. in Physics with Honors and a B.S. in Computation and Applied Mathematics with Honors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I work under Professor David Archer in the Department of Geophysical Sciences at UChicago and under Dr. Ken O. Buesseler at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. 
      In both labs, I work to develop data-constrained oceanograpnic models using statistical and physical techniques. 
      Specifically, I am interested in applying machine learning to inverse modeling and regression problems to further reduce error in theoretical carbon model output.

    <h2>What is Jekyll?</h2>

    <p>
      <code>Jekyll</code> is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator
      perfect for personal, project,
      or organization sites. Think of it like a
      file-based CMS, without all the complexity.
      <code>Jekyll</code> takes your content, renders Markdown
      and Liquid templates, and spits out a
      complete, static website ready to be served by Apache,
      Nginx or another web server.
      <code>Jekyll</code> is the engine behind GitHub Pages,
      which you can use to host sites right
      from your GitHub repositories.
